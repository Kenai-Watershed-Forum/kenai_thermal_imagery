### Introduction

On July 5, 2020, [NV5 Geospatial](https://www.nv5.com/geospatial/) collected thermal infrared imagery from a helicopter-mounted camera for four steams on the Kenai Peninsula in southern Alaska. These streams included:

-   Kenai River Tributaries

    -   Beaver Creek

    -   Funny River

    -   Moose River

-   Kasilof River Tributary

    -   Crooked Creek

All streams were flown during the afternoon hours in order to maximize the thermal contrast between the river's water and the banks.

The surveys extend for a total length of 59.1 km of the streams, covering upstream extents from their outlets at the Kenai or Kasilof rivers. The data were collected to aid the team in identifying the spatial variability in surface temperatures as well as thermal influence of point sources, tributaries, and surface springs.

Specific deliverables generated by NV5 Geospatial from the thermal imagery data include:

-   Rasters (map image files; .tif and .jpg formats)

-   Shapefiles (longitudinal temperature profiles, stream centerlines, others; .shp format)

-   Other supplemental items (coordinates of significant thermal features, maps and figures, and others)

The full technical report from NV5 Geospatial describing detailed methods and interpretation can be accessed at the following link:

The image raster files are of a large size (\~3 GB) and may be acquired by contacting staff at Cook Inletkeeper, Kenai Watershed Forum, or Kachemak Heritage Land Trust.

### Parcel data summary

We generated a table in GIS (ArcMap Pro 10.8.1) where the cold-water features (e.g. seeps, springs) identified from thermal infrared imagery in July 2020 intersect with property parcels within Beaver Creek, Crooked Creek, Moose River, and Funny River in the Kenai River watershed.

```{r, include = F}


# read in most columns
tbl <- read.csv("input/parcels/csv/parcel_and_significant_feature_intersect.csv") %>%
  select(note,
         Strm_Name,

         M_Off_str,
         Rvr_meas,
         Rvr_km,
         Rvr_mile,
         Mean, Median, Min,  Max, Std_Dev,   
         Site_Name,

         PARCEL_ID,

# Create table with information relevant for ground-truthing fieldwork

# read in a reduced set of columns
tbl1 <- tbl %>%
  select(Strm_Name,
         Latitude, Longitude,
         Site_Name,
         note,
         Rvr_mile,

         OWNER,
         OWNTYPE,
         PARCEL_ID,
         LANDVAL) 

# rename columns

colnames(tbl1) <- names

# prep order
tbl1 <- tbl1 %>%
  arrange(Stream_Name)


```

Figure \@ref(fig:parcel-plot) summarizes the ownership type of parcels identified to contain thermal features within each watershed.

```{r, include = F}
t <- tbl1 %>%
  count(Stream_Name,Owner_Type) 
```

<br>

```{r parcel-plot, fig.cap="Parcel ownership ", echo = FALSE}

ggplotly(
  p <- tbl1 %>%
    ggplot(aes(Stream_Name, fill = Owner_Type)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single")) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Parcel Count") +
    ggtitle("Parcels Containing Thermal Features by Owner Type")
  )
```

### Maps

In order to visualize detailed overlay of thermal features with parcel boundaries, we created a collection of static map images focused on individual parcels. Researchers with participating organizations used these maps in tandem with the [ArcGIS Online project map](https://arcg.is/fzn14) to assess conservation priorities within each study watersheds, and contributed notes on a shared platform. These collective notes are used internally to develop shared conservation priorities.

Project collaborators may access the Google Sheet using this link: [Thermal Imagery Parcel Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGnxuaW70K7ZFb-m4krSRx3WcKxHqhBRN-Muowr5HFc/edit#gid=0). 

An example map is shown in \@ref(fig:example-map).

```{r example-map, echo = F, fig.cap = "Example of airborne thermal infrared imagery map with parcel overlay", out.height=325, out.width=375}
